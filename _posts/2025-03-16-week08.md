title: Week 8 Reflection on two presentations
---

## Intro

This week, I had the pleasure of attending a compelling presentation by Nick Vidal from OSI, who introduced and explored the evolving concept of the "Open Source AI Definition." Reflecting on this insightful talk, I encountered several surprising points.

## Any surprising things
One particularly surprising revelation was how the definition of open source is adapting to address the unique challenges posed by artificial intelligence. Traditionally, open source principles emphasize transparency, collaboration, and accessibility. However, AI introduces complexities such as data privacy, reproducibility, and interpretability, requiring more nuanced and tailored definitions. Nick Vidal's presentation illuminated the careful balance required to maintain openness while responsibly managing sensitive data and ensuring ethical AI use.

## View of open source being used by financial industry change
My view of open source's potential in the financial industry shifted significantly as well. Previously, I assumed finance, given its stringent regulatory environment and competitive nature, would remain predominantly reliant on proprietary solutions. However, the presentation made it clear that financial institutions increasingly embrace open source AI technologies to enhance transparency, innovation, and security. This trend indicates a growing confidence in open source as a viable strategy for managing complex and sensitive operations.

## Changes on ideas about open source AI
Furthermore, my overall perspective on open source AI evolved notably. Initially, I considered open source AI primarily as a technical and academic resource. But Vidal's insights clarified its broader commercial applicability and emphasized its role in promoting ethical practices, fairness, and collaboration across industries. Open source AI isn't just about accessible codeâ€”it's about fostering trust and collective responsibility in AI advancements.
