title: Week 6 Reflection on my open source contributions
---

## How are things going?
So far, my open-source journey has been going well. I started by contributing to non-code projects, such as editing and improving Wikipedia articles. This allowed me to get comfortable with the collaborative aspect of open source, understand contribution workflows, and learn how to communicate effectively within a community. It has been a great way to ease into open source while making meaningful contributions to knowledge-sharing platforms.

## What types of contributions were you able to make?
Most of my contributions have been in non-code areas, such as improving documentation, fixing typos, and enhancing the clarity of Wikipedia articles. These contributions helped me understand the importance of maintaining high-quality information in open-source projects. Additionally, I have explored some code repositories, but I haven’t made significant code contributions yet. However, I have been familiarizing myself with different project structures, reading through discussions, and understanding how contributors collaborate on coding tasks.

## What are the biggest challenges?
The biggest challenge I have faced is transitioning from non-code contributions to code contributions. Many open-source projects have complex codebases, making it difficult to understand their structure. Unlike documentation projects, where contributions are more straightforward, code projects often require deep technical knowledge, and I found that many repositories lack beginner-friendly issues. Without clear guidance, it can be intimidating to figure out where to start. I am currently working on improving my ability to read and navigate large codebases so that I can confidently contribute to code-focused projects.

## Which contribution are you most proud of?
At this stage, I don’t have a “most proud of” contribution yet, as I am still in the process of making my first meaningful code contribution. However, I am proud that I took the first steps into open source by contributing to Wikipedia and other documentation-focused projects. My next goal is to find a suitable coding project where I can make my first contribution, whether it's fixing a bug, improving an algorithm, or adding a new feature. I am excited about making improvements on my contributions.
