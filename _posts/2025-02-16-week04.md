title: Week 4 Git Exercise and Group Presentation
---

## Git exercises
This week's Git exercises helped solidify my understanding of version control workflows. We practiced essential Git commands for tracking file changes, managing branches, and collaborating on projects.

A major takeaway was understanding the staging process, where files move from the working directory to the staging area (git add) and then to the repository (git commit). We also explored how to navigate commit history, switch between branches, and merge changes.

Additionally, I gained clarity on the difference between cloning a repository (git clone) and pushing changes using pull requests. These exercises emphasized how Git helps maintain a structured and efficient development process, ensuring smooth collaboration in open-source and team projects.

## Browser Extension Presentations
Each group presented their Chrome/Firefox extensions, and I was impressed by the variety of projects. It was fascinating to see different open-source extensions that people had built.
Our group created Meowtivation, an extension that greets users with a cat GIF whenever they click on it while studying. We integrated an API to fetch GIFs from Giphy, making the extension fun and engaging.

All the extensions developed by our classmates were well-structured. The README.md files clearly outlined installation and usage steps, while the CONTRIBUTING.md files detailed ways for others to contribute. These elements are critical for open-source projects, as they provide clarity for future contributors.

One of the most interesting discoveries was how different groups approached their Code of Conduct. A group working on a [Website Time Tracker](https://github.com/ossd-s25/websiteTimeTracker) had an unusual approach, stating:

"This project adheres to No Code of Conduct. We are all adults. We accept anyoneâ€™s contributions. Nothing else matters."

Unlike traditional codes of conduct, which typically outline rules for respectful collaboration, this approach embraced complete openness. It was a refreshing yet unconventional take, showing how projects can define their own cultural norms.

## Biggest takeaway
From our own project and others' presentations, my biggest realization was how crucial workflow structure is in open-source projects.

Whenever I come across an open-source project, the **README, Code of Conduct, and Contributing files** are the first things I check. These documents are essential for understanding how to contribute effectively. A well-documented project lowers the barrier for new contributors, making it easier for people to engage with and improve the project.

This experience has given me a new appreciation for open-source collaboration and the importance of clear documentation, structured workflows, and community engagement.
