This week marked a big milestone in our course: the final round of open source project presentations. Watching each group share their journey was both exciting and a little nerve-wracking. Our team presented our work on AutoGen, an advanced AI framework developed by Microsoft. Over the semester, we focused on improving both backend and frontend components, including ChainLit integration and refining user interactions within agent runtime sessions. Preparing for the presentation made me realize how much deeper our understanding of large-scale systems has become—and how many hours we spent debugging!

Seeing the other teams present added another layer of pressure. The Oppia team really stood out to me—their commitment to improving educational tools through accessible contributions was inspiring. They handled feedback gracefully and showed strong ownership over their pull requests. Similarly, the Lucide group brought a lot to the table. Their consistent contributions to icon development and UI polish were not only technically impressive, but also visually impactful. Watching their smooth demos made me wish we had a few more days to refine ours.

Overall, this week was a blend of pride and pressure. It was rewarding to share what we built, and just as motivating to see what our classmates achieved. I left class feeling more confident in my abilities—and more aware of how far I still want to go.
