#  What is Code of Conduct?
A Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that defines expected behavior within the community of contributors, users, and maintainers. It ensures that **everyone—regardless of background—feels welcome, respected, and safe** while collaborating on a project.

# Code of Conduct for GO
Like many other open-source project, [Go Programming's Code of Conduct](https://go.dev/conduct) is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/), one of the most widely adopted Codes of Conduct in open-source projects.  It is designed to create a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for contributors of all backgrounds.
However, they differ slightly in their philosophy, structure, enforcement, and scope. The Go Code of Conduct is built on "Gopher Values," emphasizing patience, thoughtfulness, respect, and collaboration. It encourages members to interpret others' actions in good faith and promotes a self-regulating environment where contributors are expected to engage in constructive discussions with mutual respect. In contrast, the Contributor Covenant takes a more formal and structured approach, explicitly defining acceptable and unacceptable behaviors. It includes strict guidelines on harassment, discrimination, and misconduct, ensuring that community members adhere to clearly stated ethical and professional standards.

# Python's Code of Conduct

Also, it is different from other code of conduct that it applies to both online & offline events.
