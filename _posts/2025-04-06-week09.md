title: Week 9 Reflection on Group Progress and Presentation

## Progress on Our Group Project 

In our group project, David and I have been working an issue and making steady progress. Recently, we've been focused on solving a challenging issue related to our custom Chainlit agent built with core autogen tools. Specifically, we’re working on a bug where our agent’s `on_message` method is unexpectedly receiving keyword arguments that the base method isn’t designed to handle. The bug we’re facing has proven to be a complex puzzle, but it’s pushing us to dive deep into debugging and exploring innovative solutions. As we enter the final few weeks of our project, our goal is to iron out this issue and polish all the remaining functionalities so that the end product is robust and user-friendly. Every setback has been an opportunity for learning, and we’re excited about the breakthroughs we anticipate in the coming weeks.

## Insights from Shivam Balikondwar’s Presentation
This week, I had the pleasure of watching a presentation by Shivam Balikondwar, an alum who now works full-time in open source. His talk was a refreshing reminder that building a career in open source isn’t just about writing code—it’s about continuously learning, embracing challenges, and being an active part of a supportive community.

Shivam’s personal journey, from overcoming early setbacks to making meaningful contributions, was particularly inspiring. His emphasis on persistence and the importance of collaborating and learning from mistakes resonated with me. One of the most interesting takeaways was how he leveraged his contributions to build a network. It’s not often that we hear about how open source contributions can spark engaging conversations and open doors to new opportunities, yet this approach has clearly helped him cultivate beneficial relationships in the tech community.

I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that Shivam viewed contributing to open source as an accessible way for beginners to practice and improve their coding skills—a strategy that makes technical growth approachable for many. Even more impressive was the fact that he wasn’t a computer science major. His journey shows that passion, persistence, and a willingness to learn can pave the way to a successful career in open source, regardless of your academic background.
