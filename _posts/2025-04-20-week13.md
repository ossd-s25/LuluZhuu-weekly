title: Week 13 Open Source in Business

## Project Update

Recently, Andrea and I identified a glitch in the project’s web front end that seemed straightforward to address. However, when we dove into the repository, we were surprised to find no relevant source files for the page in question. We hesitated to reach out, worried our oversight would make us appear inexperienced. Still, after a thorough search yielded nothing, we mustered the courage to contact the maintainers and describe our confusion. Now, we’re patiently awaiting their response, hopeful that this exchange will clarify the code structure and ultimately enable us to contribute that frontend fix. This experience reminded us that clear communication is key to effective open source collaboration.

## Reflection on Open Source in Business

I watched "the open source in film". I was fascinated to learn how open source is transforming the film world, not just as a technical resource but as a catalyst for collaboration. Rather than each studio reinventing identical pipelines, they now contribute to communal projects like OpenColorIO and Blender, easing hiring pressures and inviting learners to dive into real-world tools. The partnership between the Linux Foundation and the Academy Software Foundation exemplifies how unexpected alliances can streamline production and drive creativity. By embracing shared frameworks, filmmakers gain transparency and flexibility, allowing them to channel their efforts into storytelling rather than rebuilding the same foundations behind closed doors.
