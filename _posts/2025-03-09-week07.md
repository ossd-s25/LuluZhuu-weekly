title: Week 8 Reflection on the group work project

## How did your group decide on the project

Our group has decided to work on AutoGen AI by Microsoft for our project. It is a relatively new and small-scale open-source project.

Initially, we explored a long list of open-source projects based on programming languages such as Python, Java, and React. While we are proficient in these languages, we found that many of the projects were highly mature and developed using advanced programming techniques. As a result, the available issues were quite complex and beyond our current capabilities.

Given this challenge, we shifted our focus to smaller, less well-known projects that are still in the early stages of development. After reviewing several options, we found AutoGen, which includes issues labeled "good first issue" and "documentation"â€”indicating beginner-friendly contributions.

## Did your group hit any obstacles?

Yes. The process of searching an issue we could be able to contribute is longer than we expected. We found that even though there are several "good first time" issues in Autogen, but most of them are open last last year and haven't been closed yet. There were 3 issues labeled with "good first time" recently, but none of them seems easy to fix. So we might need to dive more into the project to understand it better in order to start a pull request. 

## How are you going to resolve them?
If there are not so existing "good first time" issues that could be solved, we will look at documentation part to help edit the documentation. Meanwhile, we will be actively searching for issues among more areas.
