title: Week 7 Reflection on the group work project
---

## How did your group decide on the project

Our group has decided to work on AutoGen AI by Microsoft for our project. It is a relatively new and small-scale open-source project.

Initially, we explored a long list of open-source projects based on programming languages such as Python, Java, and React. While we are proficient in these languages, we found that many of the projects were highly mature and developed using advanced programming techniques. As a result, the available issues were quite complex and beyond our current capabilities.

Given this challenge, we shifted our focus to smaller, less well-known projects that are still in the early stages of development. After reviewing several options, we found AutoGen, which includes issues labeled "good first issue" and "documentation"—indicating beginner-friendly contributions.

## Did your group hit any obstacles?

Yes, we faced challenges in identifying an issue that we could effectively contribute to. The process took longer than expected.

Although AutoGen has several issues labeled "good first issue," many of them were opened in the previous year and remain unresolved. Additionally, while three new issues with the "good first issue" label were posted recently, none of them appear to be straightforward to fix. This means we may need to explore the project in greater depth before we can confidently submit a pull request.

## How are you going to resolve them?
If we are unable to find "good first issue" tasks that we can reasonably tackle, we will shift our focus to improving the project’s documentation. Additionally, we will actively explore other areas of the project to identify issues where we can contribute. By deepening our understanding of AutoGen, we hope to find opportunities to make meaningful contributions.
