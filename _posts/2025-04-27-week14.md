## Reflection on presentations from Prewald and HuggingFace

Listening to the Prewald and Hugging Face teams present this week was both inspiring and humbling. Each group brought a level of polish and technical depth that made it clear how much progress they can pack into a semester when they lean into collaboration and rapid iteration. Their ability to articulate challenges, demo working features, and even adapt on the fly underlined just how dynamic an open-source sprint can be.

The Prewald group, in particular, wowed us with their end-to-end debugger integration. Watching their live demo, where they stepped through code, inspected variables, and traced execution paths, was eye-opening—it felt like they’d built a mini-IDE on top of an already complex codebase. Even more impressive was how they’d split tasks into pairs early on, pairing a front-ender with a back-ender to tackle each feature. That tight feedback loop showed in their seamless handoffs and kept their velocity high, despite constant pivots in requirements.

On the other side, Hugging Face’s presentation dove into the intricacies of transformers and CI pipelines—topics that none of us had hands-on experience with before. Yet they distilled their work into clear, digestible diagrams of data flow and training schedules, and even shared metrics showing how their pull-request cadence improved as they refined their review process. They didn’t shy away from admitting setbacks—model convergence issues, flaky tests—and celebrated community contributions that helped them overcome those hurdles.

Seeing these two groups set such a high bar has definitely raised the stakes for our own presentation next week. Their demos reminded us that clear documentation, modular task breakdowns, and a willingness to lean on existing tools can make all the difference. We’re feeling the pressure—in the best possible way—to sharpen our slides, tighten our demos, and push ourselves to add one or two features we hadn’t originally planned. If Prewald and Hugging Face can achieve so much in just a few months, we know we owe it to ourselves to match that energy.


## Progress on our group

This weekend our team made some real progress: we successfully merged two front-end pull requests that add the form validation flow and the responsive dashboard widget. We also submitted a back-end pull request over the weekend, which was such a big job for us because we had stuck on this issue for a long time. On top of that, we’ve sketched out and rehearsed our slide deck for next week’s presentation, so we’re heading into Monday with both solid code deliverables and a polished presentation.
